stackstrap-meanstack
====================

[MEAN Stack](https://github.com/linnovate/mean) is a great way
to get yourself running with a good mix of node.js tools

## Get Going

First (install Vagrant)[http://vagrantup.com], if you have not (that also means VirtualBox, eventually).

```bash
sudo easy_install stackstrap

stackstrap template add meanstack https://github.com/freesurface/stackstrap-meanstack

stackstrap create mynewproject meanstack

cd mynewproject

vagrant up
```

A mental break worth of waiting occurs, but it's worth it, go for a tea.
